# CommitArt

Modifying the commit history of git repositories in order to write messages
in GitHub's contribution graph.

I did this project as a way of learning how to use the
[Rugged](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged) library which is a ruby binding to
[libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2).

Check out the picture below or [see it live](https://github.com/commitart).

Using the letters from the `alphabet.yml` file, I was able to write `GITHUB`
in the contribution history.
